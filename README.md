# Old School Runescape Data Pipeline: loading S3 data into PostgreSQL 

I have been in search of a project that would allow me to do some of my own data collection and combine that in practice with my coding skills. Graduate work, searching for a job, and planning a wedding requires a lot of flexibility, so I wanted to work on something that I could pick up and put down throughout the day. This project took me back to my Old School Runescape days. Though it had been a while since playing the game, I considered collecting data therein as I anticipated being able to get a consistent amount of data from taking down the same monster in the game. The cherry on top was getting to play a favorite childhood game again!


Under the dags folder, you will find the DAG I wrote in Python. In the data folder, you will find the data that I recorded. The results folder has the CSV files, the Python script to connect to PostgreSQL to make SQL queries, and Python script in which I make graphs using matplotlib from PostgreSQL queries.
